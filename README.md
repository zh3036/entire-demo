# entire-demo

A demo repository showing how [Entire](https://entire.io) captures agent context alongside Git commits.

Every commit in this repo was generated by Claude Code with Entire Checkpoints enabled — meaning the full agent session (prompts, reasoning, tool calls, token usage) is preserved as first-class versioned metadata in Git.

## What's inside

- `fizzbuzz.py` — A configurable FizzBuzz CLI with custom rules
- `test_fizzbuzz.py` — Tests for the FizzBuzz implementation

## Powered by

- [Entire CLI](https://entire.io) — Checkpoints for agent context
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) — Anthropic's agentic coding CLI
